# My Background (1) 

--

- In Middle School

--
 - I played with BASIC and _I loved it_  
(Pro-tip: If a language uses `goto` then _go to_ another language!)

--
- In highschool
 - I _loved learning_

--
  , but was _bored_ in every class

--
  , and _hated_ homework

--
 - I had _no idea_ what I was going to do when I "grew up"
  
--

- As a Marine
 - Got my very first email address  
  (but could only email other Marines in my office ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

--
 - Was introduced to Instructional Technology  
  (& paid to code for the first time)
 
 
---

 # My Background (2) 

- As an Instructional Technologist
 - Worked with clients and designed programs (e.g. "Business Analyst")
 
--
 - Managed teams, including the developers  
 (e.g. "Project Manager", "Program Manager")
 
--
 - Earned a Masters & PhD
 
--
 - Regularly developed prototypes
 
--
 - Worked with robots 

--
that were actual automobiles

--
being used as bombing targets on military ranges


--
- As a hobbyist

--
 - I've been an active "Maker"
 - Love playing with microcontrollers
 - Still a noob at 3D printing
 

---

# My Background (3) 

- As a developer
 - Started a group for novice & junior web devs

--
 - Helped build an in-browser database

--
 - Taught Web Development to other career changers

--
 - Gotten back to Instructional Tech (_I'm much happier as a developer_)

# Is college the right choice for you? (1)

--
- Most likely, yes

--
- Better questions
 - Is college the right choice for you _now_?
 - Is full-time ‚Äî_or more_‚Äî college right for you?
 - Is a _4 year_ college or university program right for you?

---

# Is college the right choice for you? (2)

- If you _know_ what you want out of college  
 _and_ have scholarships, grants, etc. (i.e. don't need student loans)  
 _then_ a 4 year college or university program is probably a good bet for you

--
- If you _don't know_ what you want out of college  
 _or_ you don't have funding  
 _then_ a community college is actually a great alternative to start with

--
- If at all possible
 - have a 3/4 time to full-time job, in your degree area or desired career domain (your employeer should also help with tuition)

--
 - double-major
 
--
 - become proficient in at least one non-English spoken language (e.g. Spanish, Chinese, Russian, French)
